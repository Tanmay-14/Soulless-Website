                <p>You live a simple life as a doctor in a simple town... Until a train ride at midnight leads you straight into the hands of a dangerous demon lord! In order to save your life you give away your soul and make a deal with him... thinking you might be able to get away... But even stranger and darker things await you as your fate gets entangled with that of the demons in the Dark World... 
                    Can you trust them? Can you save them? Can you love them?</p>

He walks with the burden of a very dark past and a kingdom on the verge of destruction, which threatens to break him and corrupt him. Can you keep up with him and shoulder his burdens, or will you watch as he gets crushed under their weight?</p>

Impulsive and a little short tempered, she's never afraid of jumping into trouble and always knows what to do. Edith wears her heart on her sleeve and expresses freely, be it love or hate. All she asks for is your help for her people. Can you understand her motives and help her, or will you fall prey to her suspicions?</p>

He's gentle and soft, but just as fierce and determined. He will give his all to save and protect people, because he can't bear to watch anyone die... not after what he's been through. Can you be with him in his sorrows or will you end up being another one of his bad memories? </p>

She's one amongst three of Lucien's Faithful Servants and helps him manage things in the castle in his absence. Lilian is very shy and always smiles, but sometimes her plastic smile slips and you can barely see the exhaustion in her eyes... and maybe something more. Can you find out her secrets or will it be too late until you do? </p>
